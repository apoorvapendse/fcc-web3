oracle: 
Any device that interacts with the off-chain(data not on blockchain) world to provide external data or computation to the smart contracts
The oracle itself has to be decentralized 

hybrid smart contracts : on chain ddata + Doracles  

Chainlink = decentralized oracle network

DAO = decentralized autonomous org


Transaction Fee = Gas Price * Units of Gas used

Hash: 
A unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing data into a said hash function
SHA stands for secure has algo
ethereum block chain uses keccak256 which is quite similar to SHA256 but keccak256 is more powerful

what miners is they try to find the nonce for any given data so that the hash of nonce and data is below certain value. That requires bruteforce iteration for every nonce value over and comparing its hash

block: list of transactions mined together (their hash is obtained by iterating with various nonce values);
nonce = number used once 
also used to measure no of transactions from a given address 

private key is used to digitally sign transaction which can then be verifed using your public key 
however you cannot decrypt the private key from the digitally signed hash

gas summary:
as more and more people use a chain, the cost per transaction will increase

sending eth by default takes 21k gas

1 Ether (ETH) = 1e9 Gwei
1 Gwei = 1e9 Wei
1 Ether (ETH) = 1e18 Wei
